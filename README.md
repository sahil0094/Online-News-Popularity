# Online-News-Popularity
Online News Popularity
The data comes from Mashable, a well-known online news website. 
I have implemented different learning algorithms on the dataset, ranging from various count regression technique to Logistic Regression, Decision Tree,Random Forest,Gradient Boost and XGBoost.My work can help online news companies to improve news popularity. 

# File Descriptions:
<ul>
<li>Online News Popularity_continuous.ipynb- Taking target as discrete variable and performed count based regressions.
<li>Online_News_Popularity_Binary.ipynb- Converting target into two classes and performed binary classification
<li>Online_News_Popularity_Multiclass.ipynb- Checking possibilty of multiple classes using clustering techniques.
<li>Sample analysis.ipynb- Web scrapped one article using beautiful soup and calculated all column values for that particular article using NLP
<li>Univariate_Analysis.html- Univariate analysis using Pandas profiling library
<li>Webapp.zip -Web app made in flask to demonstrate working of model 
<li>Fnal_report.pdf - Final report describing the whole process used for the project
